Problem Statement: Using the electric vehicle dataset (which includes information on EV populations, vehicle types, and possibly historical charging usage), create a model to forecast future EV adoption. For example, predict the number of electric vehicles in upcoming years based on the trends in the data.

Goal: Build a regression model that forecasts future EV adoption demand based on historical trends in EV growth, types of vehicles, and regional data.

Dataset: This dataset shows the number of vehicles that were registered by Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) each month. The data is separated by county for passenger vehicles and trucks.
